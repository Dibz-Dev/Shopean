- Functional shopping List designed to make shopping easier as all your items are grouped together in their respective categories.
- Shopean already has default items in the database however, if the item you want to add is not already on the database you can go 
   to the create Item modal and add as many as you like.
- To gain access to the homepage and list functionality you need to create an account and then login.
- All passwords are hashed so accounts are secure, the only required details is an email address and password.
